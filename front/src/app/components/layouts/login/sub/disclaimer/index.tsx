            <p>
                The main purpose of the SONM Wallet is the operational work with the SONM system.
            </p>
            <p>
                For your convenience the Wallet is made as a utility tool with a wide range of functions that include a—Åcount management, sending Ether and SNM tokens.
            </p>
            <p>
                We take reasonable security measures about the safety of your Keystore files and Private Keys, but we must explicitly note that independent security audit was not performed yet. Besides, we (like many other projects) use external libraries and dependencies that may contain vulnerabilities, that may lead to an information leak.

                <br />
                Cryprocurrencies is a fast evolving technology, many different wallets were hacked at different times. The only safe way to keep your cryprocurrency is the <b>cold storage</b>.
                Safety requires solid understanding of what is happening, ideally you should understand why the <b>cold storage</b> is the only safe option. This is a subject of a personal research.

                    The way to safely work with Ether and tokens is the subject of a separate personal study by every citizen and <b className="sonm-disclaimer__pink">NOT TRIVIAL.</b> It requires specialized knowledge and research.
